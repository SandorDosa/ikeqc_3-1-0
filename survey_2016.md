# 2016 Survey Results

## Summary:

Since AS XXXV (35), IKEqC has been available online as a means for Society for Creative Anachronism Equestrians throughout the Known World to participate remotely in specific SCA Equestrian Skill at Arms Elements (aka, The Games), submitting their scores according to well-defined rules, and using their own scores to show their progress and to compare with others from across the Known World. As equestrian programs have grown in many areas these past two decades, making more opportunities for in-person competition, there was a need to reassess the role of IKEqC. Score submissions have decreased these past two years. Was IKEqC still useful? If so, what changes should be made?

 
Input from current and future participants was needed as part of this reassessment. From October through December 2016 the SurveyMonkey tool was used to gather information from SCA equestrians about IKEqC. The results are detailed below but there are two observations:

* More than two questions should probably be asked in the future, and the number of options for responding to them should be increased

* The comments that 40% of the responders took the extra time to submit were extremely valuable in providing information that the survey questions did not and are being used to plan changes in IKEqC 3.0

The result is that IKEqC 3.0 will again encourage scores on all the included Skill at Arms Elements. We are going to encourage discussions about adding new games and about rotating the championship amongst the Skill at Arms Elements.  We will explore adding a combination of different Skill at Arms Elements scores, similar to what one might encounter in a challenge course at an event, in order to showcase different skills.

Survey Questions

The two questions asked with their options (and the responses) were:

1. Why do you want to participate in the Interkingdom Equestrian Competition?

    > a. It is a way to measure my SCA equestrian skills and abilities – 79%
    >
    > b. It is a way for people to know about me and my horse – 27.4%
    >
    > c. It is a way for me to compete against equestrians from other kingdoms – 59.7%
    >
2. What Mounted Archery activity would you prefer to submit scores for the 2015/2016 IKEqC year?

    > a. Single shot – 14%
    >
    > b. Triple shot – 15.6%
    >
    > c. Either one is OK as long as we get to do Mounted Archery! – 70.3%

## Survey Comments

The comments indicated that using Mounted Archery for the championship had discouraged some participants due to the difficulty in being able to set up ranges at practices and events in their area and the special authorization required. The comments also emphasized the importance of including scores for all the games not just Mounted Archery, and rotating the championship activity each year among the games as had been done in prior years.  Several cited the usefulness of IKEqC in allowing comparison of progress to other equestrians, other kingdoms. The importance of IKEqC to those beginning in SCA equestrian was also mentioned. There was an interest in adding new games or new combinations of games – head to head IKEqC was specifically mentioned. Overall, comments indicated that IKEqC was still useful if some modifications were made. IKEqC 3.0 is the response.
