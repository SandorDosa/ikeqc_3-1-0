###  About:
At its inception in 1993 the Inter-Kingdom Equestrian Competition, or IKEqC as it became commonly known, set out to become the SCA Equestrian equivalent of the Inter-Kingdom Archery Competition.  

Allowing riders to submit multiple scores to a rigid framework of rules allows for the comparison of talent and abillties between competitors that might never meet.  This project supports the IKEqC with material software and hosting support as well as a clearinghouse for other information of benifit to the IKEqC and even greater SCA Equestrian community.
