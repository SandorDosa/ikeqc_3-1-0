# Three Point OH!
If you've been reading through these pages, you no doubt have seen referenences to something called "IKEqC Three-point-OH!" and this is what it is.  

* The suite if software that runs the IKEqC, ScoreKeeper, is undergoing its second major renovation.  Hence, version three.

* The actual tournament itself is going through its second major renovation too.  So there is symetry here.

# The Class at [Gulf Wars](gulfwarsxxvi)

Dame Macha the Determined, THL Donwenna La Mareschale, and Lord Sandor Dosa will be teaching about the changes in the games, in the software, and most importantly, changes in the ways we will run the IKEqC.  Its probably a good thing that there is not a class scheduled after ours as I think that its going to be a challenge to present everything in 90 minutes.

Dame Macha will review the changes to the rules.  There are not many, but we are taking this opportunity to make a few more adjustments to the games to ensure the scoring has consistient weight across all of the games.

THL Donwenna will review the history of IKEqC.  She is working very hard at putting together a great presentation for you.

Lord Sandor will have a lot to share about the website.  In addition to everything new, Sandor will hold a AMAA about things IKEqC to answer questions about the new or the old and to help foster understanding of the software, the decisions around its creation, and how it is being handled moving forward.

## Outline of changes

1. Top-down review of what works and what isn't working.
2. Spreading the administration out so that there are several people to contact in case of diffiuclties.
3. Rewrite of the code that drives the IKEqC, both for "future-proofing" and to keep the code from becoming more of a digital anachronism that it already is (15 years in software-years makes something like middle ages old, but I digress)
4. Shifting emphasis from running all the games to running what you can run. It is acceptable to run part of a Challenge Course with an IKEqC Compliant part.
# Let me say that again: IT IS OKAY TO RUN IKEqC GAMES AS PART OF A BIGGER CHANLLENGE COURSE!!!
5. Bringing in new eyes and fresh talent to help build a tournament that will continue to be of value to the SCA Equestrian community.

# Brief Version History

## The IKEqC

Version 1 was the original way of doing things.  For 8 years scores were recorded on paper and turned into the Admin for tabulation and storage.  Newsletters received reports from the Admin

Version 2 shifted the data-entry from the Admin to the EMiC running an event.  This reduced the burden on the Admin to a reasonable level.

Version 3 refines the changes in Version 2, and adds more members to form an Administrative Team as well as looking at the several games on an indivual basis rather than as an all-or-nothing approach for the Championship as was done in years past.

## ScoreKeeper (the software)

Version 1 was a direct translation of the spreadsheet provided by the Admin.

Version 2 saw the creation of EMiC event pages, allowing them to see in real-time the status of their scores.

Version 3 will see the adoption of Mobile-friendly and even Mobile-First designs to allow for better use on the field.

# Closing Thoughts

These changes are about making things easier.  Easier to run.  Easier to find.  Easier to play.   It is our hope that with easier games will come more scores.  And if you look at the [survey](survey_2016) results, thats what people want out of the IKEqC.
