# Welcome to the Crystal Ball

There have been an number of ideas floated about for ways to improve the IKEqC and frankly, some of them are really great.  That said I'm just one person, and when I'm not working for my mundane existence I can spend time coding for the IKEqC.

In order to understand what motivates me, have a brief look at the [IKEqC history](history) and it will show you that I didn't have the advantage of living where there was a locally accessable group of SCA Equestrians.  Finding a way to improve horsemanship in the SCA took many twists and turns and in the end I choose to help develop the IKEqC.

Sandor has a lot of ideas, but not always so much time to develop.  This list is just a guide, some items might not ever appear, and others might appear sooner than others.  The list is grouped in scope, but the items are not presented in any real order.

# Short Range
### These items are things that you should see soon

* Mobile First versions of the entire site.  From entering to viewing scores. 
On track to have the beta site ready for [Gulf Wars XXVI](gulfwarsxxvi).
* Event pages.  Keep up with specific events in near real time.
On track to have a Demo of this for the [IKEqC-3-point-OH! class](three_point_oh).
* Editing a Rider or Horse.  This has long beeen needed, and will allow you to keep the IKEqC up to date with your information.  The code for this is complete, just need to finish coding the interface.
* Feedback box.  Yes, Sandor wants feedback from the people that use what he makes.  There will be a link to a place to drop a line to Sandor where it will get recorded and read.

# Medium Range
### Don't expect to see these things before AS LII

* Career pages.  Look up the top runs of a particular rider.
* Adding images to the pages where approprate (Rider's device and/or badge, Their likeness, and the likeness of their horse) 
* Fantasy Tournaments.  Similar to Fantasy Football, see a Rider's cherry-picked best scores from across time!
* Horse pages.  Look up all the scores a given horse has been ridden for.
* Twitter/Facebook Integration.  Get updates on Events, Games, Riders, or Horses that you want to follow, by getting notices when they sign up for events, post scores, or get recognized by a new milestone.
* Milestones.  Get recognized when you crack the tweleve-seconds-heads barrier, or when your a local champion, and when your the overall tournament champion.

#Long Range
### These are harder to quantify, when and if they will ever happen.

* Offering Native iOS and Android Apps.  This is probably one of the more frequent questions, and it has one of the more complicated answers.  Currently Sandor does not program in Objective-C (iOS) or Java (Android).  This might change as time goes one.   One of the reasons Sandor has put so much work into building a web-based app is the platform-agnostic power of such a system.
* Elimination of those blankety-blank paper scoresheets.  Sorry, they are not going away soon.  In addition to being a backup method of data storage, its also something of a requirement for maintaining records.  Its just too likely that SCA events will sometimes occur where internet access just will not be available or practical.  If Sandor can dope out mobile apps, then it might be possible to engineer an offline mode for them.
* Better long term automation for End-of-Year closeout (Behind-the-scenes stuff)
