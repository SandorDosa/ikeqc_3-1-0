title: Birjas
---

This game has a rider attempt to thread a javlin or lance through a hoop, and without dislodging the hoop from its base, toss the javlin or lance and catch it before it falls past their grasp, while running the course at their divisional gait: Walk, Trot, or Canter.

Birjas is a documented period game of horsemanship that is not well understood or played often.

Scoring is based on succesfully completeing each of three tries at the hoop.
