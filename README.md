At its inception in 1993 the Inter-Kingdom Equestrian Competition, or IKEqC as it became commonly known, set out to become the SCA Equestrian equivalent of the Inter-Kingdom Archery Competition.  

In late AS XXXV (April 2001) Sandor launched Version 1 of the Scorekeeper website.  This first edition was rather simple, merely translating the spreadsheet to a web-native form.
Within six months of the website going live, Sandor started development of Scorekeeper V2.  

Version 2.0 launched with the TLD scaikeqc.org on first day of AS XXXVII, May 1st 2002.

Versions 2.2 and 2.4 were internal releases, it wasn't until 2007 with Version 2.7 that more games were added.

In 2012 Sandor handed the project off to another person who focused on adding CSS support and getting the HTML up to date.

Its now 2017 and its time for a top-down refresh.  Sandor is back and coding on the next version of the site and its scripts.

Version 3 will provide mobile support and mobile-enabled submission and event tracking pages as well as a general cleanup of 15 years of collected 'legacy code' including the the dreaded "mysql_query" problem.
