At its inception in 1993 the Inter-Kingdom Equestrian Competition, or IKEqC as it became commonly known, set out to become the SCA Equestrian equivalent of the Inter-Kingdom Archery Competition.  A grand tournament to allow every rider in the known world to compare themselves against other riders they might never meet with a set of standards and scoring that would permit the reasonable comparison of talent and abillity.

The ScoreKeeper project was envisioned to bring the scores out of printed periodicals and into the Internet where riders would not have to wait until the next time the scores were published to see the results.
