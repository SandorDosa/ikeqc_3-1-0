Sandor will be there and will have a host of information about the system, its use, and more imporantly will be available for questions about the system and the choices that were made that went into the design.

#Bug Hunt
A 'bug hunt' will be hosted and Sandor will offer a prize to the best bug found in his own work (please be gentle on the ego folks).
