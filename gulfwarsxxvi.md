# Its a wrap folks!

It was so wonderful getting to see everyone and talk IKEqC and even -- with a help from a new friend -- ride a little.

We came back from war with a new perspective on a few things and we are going to be using that to make things a little more simple and a little clearer.

Donwenna managed to Facebook Live most of the class and I have posted a [gallery of some of the 1k+ pictures](http://arconian.com/sandor) I took at the war.

## After-effects of IKEqC Three-point-OH!

As a direct result from the class, there are several points that will get addressed.

* Behead the Enemy pattern clarifaction -- This is in process now.
* Two Handed Birjas changes  -- This may result in two handed Birjas being dropped for LII.
* Specific language edits in various places -- This will be an ongoing process for the next little bit.
* Alterations in Mounted Archery rules based on our experiances running a Mounted Archery Single Target course, mostly about course setup and rider instructions.
* Alterations to scoring sheets based on Sandor's experiances in keeping the scores for the MAST course
* A lot of good feedback from a number of folks, more whom than I remember names for.  Thank you all!
