#IKEqC Three-point-OH!

There will be a class offered on the next generation of IKEqC at Gulf Wars XXVI.  As part of the class several folks will be asked to participate as mock EMiCs or Riders in a mock event.  Scores will be entered as the class watches and we will see together who will 'win' the mock event.  Be sure to bring your elfboxes and tailless farspeakers!

#AMAA (Ask Me ALMOST Anything)
Sandor will be there and will have a host of information about the system, its use, and more imporantly will be available for questions about the system and the choices that were made that went into the design.

#Bug Hunt
A 'bug hunt' will be hosted and Sandor will offer a prize to the best bug found in his own work (please be gentle on the ego folks).
