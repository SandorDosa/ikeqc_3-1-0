# Humble Beginings...

In the begining there were scores, and some of them were good!  These scores were shared by newsletters and often seen once a year at most outside of the most active of equestrian perodiocals.

The Inter-Kingdom Equestrian Competition or IKEqC for short, was founded in 1993 as a means to allow [SCA](http://www.sca.org) Equestrians to compare their skills with others in other kingdoms in an annunal competition that would honor the best rider in all the lands.

In those early days there were only two games, [Behead the Enemy](heads) and [Ring Tilt](rings).  The 'Enemy' here was often re-dubbed "Infidel", "Saracen", or even "Target" as each way of labeling the game had some connection to period documents and the biases of those running the events.

These two games were not all of the games played by SCA Equestrians, but the two games choosen that could be easily defined by a set of reasonbly reproducable rules.  It was that need for reproducibility that kept other games such as the Quintain from being considered.

# Administrative Burdens

In the years after the IKEqC was founded, the popularity of SCA Horsemanship had increased.  More games were being played at more events and IKEqC was becoming commonplace either as a stand-alone event or as part of the ever-popular Challenge Courses that were being setup.  In fact many non-IKEqC events would run variations of a Behead the Enemy and Ring Tilt courses.

I myself stumbled into the SCA Equestrian community at an event in AS XXVII (1993 Gregorian), ironically it was also the first I heard of [Gulf Wars](http://gulfwars.org) when the new war treaty was announced at court.

I was enthralled beyond normal enthusiasm even though I lived where there were no other SCA Equestrians nearby.  This tempered my abillity to participate for many years, and even after buying my own horse three years later.  Alas, I'm getting ahead of myself.

What I didn't know then was that the work of receiving, tabulating, and reporting the scores of the IKEqC was becoming a heavy burden on the administrator of the IKEqC.  I would learn of this burden when I ran into THL Donwenna La Mareschale, then administrator of the IKEqC, at Gulf Wars X (2001 Gregorian) while walking through the equestrian areas.  

She was working on polishing the brass on her saddle and after striking up a conversation with her, I learned that one of the most sure-fire ways to make friends in the Equestrian community is to sit down and helpwith chores!  With an extra pair of hands to polish the brightmetal, the task was accomplished much faster.

I learned that the IKEqC I read about in '93 was still around and was becoming diffiuclt to run.  I exchanged emails with Donwenna to catch up after the war, and in short order I had a plan to help get the IKEqC on the web.

# Small first steps

Before I came along, the scores were kept both in paper files and in an Microsoft Office Excel spreadsheet, to aid in publication of the scores to Kingdom Newsletters, the Society Equestrian Officer's Newsletter Hoofbeats, and to other interested publications.  There was no alternative to these Newsletters other than to download the Excel spreadsheet from Donwenna's IKEqC homepage.

I began researching the problem and discovered there was a way to take that data, translate it into a slightly different format, bang on the bits a little bit, and cram the result into a database that I could then use to drive a dynamic scores page online.  ScoreKeeper was born.  Within a month of Gulf Wars X, I had IKEqC scores online in a fashion that was much more friendly to the eyes than a spreadsheet.

You can still see AS [XXXV](http://scaikeqc.org/xxxv) and [XXXVI](http://scaikeqc.org/xxxvi) scores displayed using the original ScoreKeeper system.

# ScoreKeeper v1.0

In truth, the simplicity of ScoreKeeper was that I didn't do anything more than take the spreadsheet, translate it, populate a database, and dynamically build the page whenever the website was accessed.  All of the data entry was still being done by Donweena and she was growing closer and closer to burn out.  Throughout AS XXXVI (2001) it became clear that there was an easier way to get the data into the database than me monkey-wrenching a spreadsheet into MySQL.  That would mean that Donwenna wouldn't to spend all of the hobby time on scores, and that would make the IKEqC much easier to run.

All of these things were gathered into project to push the data-entry task to the Marshals that ran equestrian events.  Suddenly I had a design for ScoreKeeper v2.0

# ScoreKeeper v2.0

My aim was to start fresh with the turn of AS XXXVII (May 1st, 2002 to April 30th, 2003 Gregorian) to launch the new IKEqC website from its new host, [scaikeqc.org](http://scaikeqc.org) where it resides even now.  The new system created an Event page for the Equestrian-Marshal-in-Charge or EMiC.  This event page would allow them to manage their scores to be submitted.  The scores would be calculated for the EMiC and the results saved in the database and this would give the site the data it needed to display.  Donwenna's job quickly became just signing off on the work of the EMiCs that were running events, not tabulating, calculating, and keying in all of the data herself.

The burden became so much more manageable, that a third new game was added for the AS XXXVII year, [Reed Chop](reeds).

Like anything new, there were a few hiccups here and there, but they were dealt with and things progressed forward.  Refinements to the setup were made and everything churned along well.

AS XXXVII was the also the zenith year, with 245 scores from 31 events.

# A fourth game...

New for AS XXXIX was [Mounted Archery](moarch).  As the fourth major IKEqC game, it would come to be the white elephant for several years, even if it was talked about with a lot of enthusiasm.  Part of the difficulties with Mounted Archery was the course requirements that needed to be set aside for it.  This cooled the enthusiasm of some.  Also about this time, mounted crest combat was up and coming.  This led to equestrian events have to pick and choose what they would support.

ScoreKeeper v2.3 handled the change without difficulty.  One of the more subtle changes to the IKEqC was tweaking of the scores, dropping of the time tables from the Heads scoring system, and general improvements to the way things were handled 'under-the-hood'.

I might have been a bit optimistic to add a fourth game as the last addition -- Reed Chop -- was still not being widely offered at events.

# AS XL Fortieth Year.

It was the first time since I had been involved with the IKEqC that Behead the Enemy was not part of the overall championship.  It also was the year that the tournament champion didn't run that game.  Other changes were coming.  

Donwenna passed the baton to Marguerite du Royon and all was running well.

# A fifth game...

AS XLI Brought forth a fifth game, [Birjas](birjas).  The game itself is well documented, and there was an well-done article about it in Complete Anachronist and later reprinted in Tournaments Illuminated (no online version exists as I am aware of at this writing).  Other tweaks were made and generally it was not much more than patching for the next year.

About this time other mounted games outside of the IKEqC were becoming very popular, in particular mounted combat and the SCA version of jousting.  Neither of which were good candidates for inclusion into the IKEqC.  The rules for IKEqC were well known, but one of the games was almost unknown and another required an additional rider's authorization above that for the other games.  

The focus on Mounted Archery and Birjas as new games seemed to take away from the other games.  Fewer events offered IKEqC compliant courses and overall participation declined.

# AS XLII

Marguerite du Royon passed the baton to Svana Mjobeina who is best remembered for her handmade champion's prize of a Bridle.  Birjas had still not taken off, worse, Mounted Archery was suffering as well.  The other three games were well represented in the scores submitted.

I was winding down my active support in the coding of things IKEqC, having found a deputy in Doucette de Verdun who was very interested in taking the framework of pages I had built 
seven years before and make them look modern and implement a few changes that would future-proof the site for years to come.

# AS XLIV 

Svana Mjobeina passed the baton to Doucette de Verdun, who after working on the website as my deputy had succeeded me in maintaining it.  I took on a new job mundanely that limited my ability to do things SCA altogether.

Donwenna was deployed to the Middle-East in mundane military service during this time, and that left her with all she could handle just running the [Hunt Guild](http://www.huntguild.org) and the [An Tir Royal Equestrian Guild](http://www.equestrianguild.antir.sca.org/).

# IKEqC interuptus...

There were no scores entered for AS XLVII.  Some of this had to be due to factors external to the SCA, because times were tough for many, and traveling with horses to compete at events might have been an expense that few were able to make.  My own SCA habit had been put aside because my job just didn't leave me time to play.

There are only a handful of scores for AS XLVIII and XLIX, and none for AS L.  Its the waning months of AS LI as I write this, and while there is a big to do planned for Gulf Wars this year, there has been nothing else reported to the IKEqC website for this year either.

# The Survey

During the SCA's jubilee 50th year event, talk of things IKEqC was brought up.  Donwenna and administrators past were consulted on the state of the games, and even a new voice was heard, that of Dame Macha the Determined.  As Donwenna's deployement to the Middle East in mundane military service had concluded, she was getting asked by many people about the IKEqC.

A [Survey](survey_2016) was sent out and the seventy or so responses were shockingly different than the small numbers of scores submitted to the IKEqC database in recent years would allude to.  Plans were made to revive the IKEqC.

Donwenna and Macha reached out to me, and to others to help rebuild the IKEqC.

# IKEqC Forward!

As I write this, it is February 16, AS LI (2017 Gregorian).  Its been almost sixteen years since I ran across Donwenna at the Equestrian barn at Gulf Wars X.  Plans are being made to make Gulf Wars XXVI the site of the IKEqC's phoenix-pyre.  I think thats rather fitting, because for me and scaikeqc.org thats where it began.  Its all starting to come together to bring you back the tournament so many of you want to return.

I am hard at work building new mobile-friendly pages and scoring systems (EMiCs will be able to enter scores as their events progress, participants and fans can see these scores come in -- in near real time -- and use that to help cheer on their friends to victory or console them in defeat.

New features are being considered, and several will be talked about at Gulf Wars and in the future.  Things are looking bright for the IKEqC again, but to keep building this momentum we need the help of the SCA Equestrians too.  Tell the folks that run equestrian events that you want to run IKEqC games.  Let them know they can thread the IKEqC games into their Challenge Course, that they can pick and choose which games they want to try and offer too.

Where the IKEqC goes from here, who can say.  The IKEqC stands ready to support the tournament for you to participate in.

Lord Sandor Dosa, Febuary 16th, AS LI.
