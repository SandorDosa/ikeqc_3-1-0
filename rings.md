# Ring Tilt

This untimed game has riders attempting to spear and collect on their lance, one of a pair of rings spaced out on three standards in a line.

These rings range from 1 inch to 6 inches in diameter and are placed so that a rider cannot take both rings.

Scoring is based on the rings on a rider's lance at the end of the run.
